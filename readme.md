## JS and CSS clock

This exercice is based on JS and basic CSS. With this two tecnologies a fully analog opeartive clock willl be built to practice and improove my CSS and Vanilla JS skills. I will be uploading some of this exercises to Github, and try to mantain and improve them by adding new features or trying to refactor the code to understand how the code works.

For the moment, the clock is not deployed to netlify or similar because there is another digital clock on progress reusing the logic of the analogic one, and some other minor changes should be added to the css, like the numbers of the clock itself.
